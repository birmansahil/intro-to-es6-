# Introduction to ES6+

This repository contains an Introduction to ES6+, which focuses on modern JavaScript features introduced with ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond. A wide range of topics are covered with hands-on challenges.

Each file in this repository represents an exercise or concept explored during the course.

## What I Learned

- Arrow Functions: Writing concise and readable functions.
- Variable Declarations: Using let and const for better scoping and immutability.
- Classes: Simplified syntax for object-oriented programming.
- Object and Array Destructuring: Efficiently extracting values.
- Promises and Fetch API: Handling asynchronous operations.
- Spread and Rest Operators: Managing collections and function arguments dynamically.
- Template Literals: Simplifying string manipulation with embedded expressions.
- Sets and Includes: Working with unique data and searching within arrays.
- For-of Loops: Cleaner and more efficient iteration over collections.

## Challenges I Faced

- Destructuring Objects and Arrays: Understanding nested destructuring and applying it effectively in real-world scenarios.
- Promises and Asynchronous Code: Learning to chain promises correctly and handle errors gracefully.
- Spread and Rest Operators: Implementing these operators in complex cases like merging objects or filtering data.
- Using Fetch: Dealing with real API responses and ensuring proper error handling was a learning curve.
